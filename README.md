A Python library for fault tolerance simulations of the surface code
using the blossom 5 perfect matching algorithm

Two different scenarios are covered by this library

* Planar code implemented in solid state spins
* Surface code (planar and toric) simulated under a general description of the noise on stabilizer measurements


## Solid state spin implementation of the surface code


## Surface code under noisy stabilizer measurements
